Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them such that all negative integers appear before all the positive integers in the array without using any additional data structure like hash table, arrays, etc. The order of appearance should be maintained.

Examples:

Input:  [12 11 -13 -5 6 -7 5 -3 -6]
Output: [-13 -5 -7 -3 -6 12 11 6 5]

An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.
Examples : 

Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5
Note: Order of elements is not important here.
